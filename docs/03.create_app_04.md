At this point, your app bundle directory structure should look similar to:
```
fastqc-app/
├── Dockerfile                  # Done
├── app.ini                     # Done
├── config.yml                  # Done
├── fastqc-0.11.7
│   ├── _lib
│   │   ├── CONTAINER_IMAGE     # Do not modify
│   │   └── extend-runtime.sh   # Do not modify
│   ├── app.json.j2             # Done
│   ├── job.json.j2             # Done
│   ├── runner-template.sh      # Done
│   └── tester.sh               # Do not modify
└── tests
    ├── SP1.fq                  # Done
    ├── SP1_fastqc.html         # Can remove
    └── SP1_fastqc.zip          # Can remove
```

The final steps are to deploy using the `apps-deploy` command, then run a test
job to confirm it is working


<br>
#### Deploy the app

The `apps-deploy` command takes the name of the app bundle as an argument (in
this example, '`fastqc-0.11.7`'), and does several things. First, it rebuilds the
Docker container and pushes it to your specified registry. Second, it uploads the
app bundle to your personal space on the `deploymentSystem` specified in the app
json file: `data-sd2e-projects-users`. Finally, it adds the app to the SD2E
Agave tenant.

Navigate to the top directory of the app bundle and deploy using the following
commands:
```
% cd ~/fastqc-app/
% apps-deploy fastqc-0.11.7
Build app container
  Dockerfile: Dockerfile Settings:  --push

```

If all goes well, you should see the new app in your list of private apps:
```
% apps-list -Q
username-fastqc-0.11.7
```

And, you should see a new Docker image appear the Docker Hub to which you are
registered.

#### Submit a test job

Submitting a test job has been [previously covered](02.submit_job.md) in this
user guide. Here, testing will be performed in the exact same way.

First, create a template job json file:
```
% jobs-template username-fastqc-0.11.7 > job.json
```
If it is not already present, add `"fastq": "agave://data-sd2e-community/sample/sailfish/test/read1.fastq"` to the "inputs" field of the job.json to run a test job.

Here are the expected contents of `job.json`:
```
{
  "name": "username-fastqc test-1524791360",
  "appId": "username-fastqc-0.11.7",
  "archive": true,                                                         
  "inputs": {
    "fastq": "agave://data-sd2e-community/sample/sailfish/test/read1.fastq"
  },
  "parameter": {
  }
}
```

Then, submit the test job:
```
% jobs-submit -F job.json
Successfully submitted job 833421020533756391-242ac11b-0001-007
```

Finally, when the job status is `FINISHED`, retrieve and inspect the output:
```
% jobs-output-get 833421020533756391-242ac11b-0001-007
```

More formalized testing with continuous integration is covered in a
[later section](03.apps_ci_jenkins.md) of this user guide.
