title: Migrating Apps from Maverick
tagline:
---

With Maverick reaching the end of its service, we will need to migrate apps off of Maverick onto another HPC resource. Luckily, due to containerization, this process is pretty painless. You'll simply need to replace the `executionSystem` in the app definition (app.json.j2) from `hpc-tacc-maverick-username` to the newly created `hpc-tacc-wranlger-username`.

#### Updated App Definition

This is an example of a converted Agave app definition:
```
{
  "name": "{{ agave.username }}-{{ app.name }}",
  "version": "{{ app.version }}",
  "executionType": "HPC",
  "executionSystem": "hpc-tacc-wrangler-{{ agave.username }}",
  "parallelism": "SERIAL",
  "deploymentPath": "{{ agave.username }}/apps/{{ app.name }}-{{ app.version }}",
  "deploymentSystem": "data-sd2e-projects-users",
  "defaultProcessorsPerNode": 1,
  "defaultNodeCount": 1,
  "defaultQueue": "normal",
  "label": "FastQC",
  "modules": [ "load tacc-singularity" ],
  "shortDescription": "A Quality Control application for FastQ files",
  "templatePath": "runner-template.sh",
  "testPath": "tester.sh",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "fastq",
      "value": {
        "default": "agave://data-sd2e-community/sample/sailfish/test/read1.fastq",
        "visible": true,
        "required": true
      },
      "details": {
        "label": "FASTQ sequence file"
      },
      "semantics": {
        "ontology": [ "http://edamontology.org/format_1930" ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "parameters": [],
  "outputs": []
}
```

#### Final steps
After updating the app definition to point to `hpc-tacc-wrangler-username`, you can simply run `apps-deploy` to deploy the app to the new execution system. Make sure to double check the `app.ini` file to ensure it points to the correct DockerHub username, repo, etc. Once the application has been deployed you can run a test job to ensure it's working correctly.
