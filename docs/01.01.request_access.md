#### SD2E Access
Access is restricted to SD2 project members. Your username and password will be
the same as your TACC username and password. To gain access, please follow the
instructions on this page:

[Request SD2E Access](https://sd2e.org/accounts/request-access/)

Note: If you are already logged in to SD2E.org, you will have to first logout
by [clicking here](https://sd2e.org/accounts/logout), then retry the link above.
Account confirmation may take up to 1-2 business days.

<br>
#### GitLab
Depending on how you plan to interact with and use the SD2E platform, you may
also need access to the [SD2E Gitlab](https://gitlab.sd2e.org/). Once your TACC
account and SD2E access are confirmed, request access to Gitlab by posting in
the `#cyberinfrastructure` channel of the
[SD2E Team Slack](https://sd2e.slack.com/messages).

<br>
#### Docker Hub
Several components of the SD2E platform utilize Docker images. To make full use
of this platform, create a personal [Docker Hub account](https://hub.docker.com/)
if you do not have one already.
