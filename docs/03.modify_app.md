Agave [apps](03.old_create_app.md) are described by `json` files and added to the
SD2E tenant using the command line interface. To modify an  app after it has
been added, simply edit the original `json` file and use the command line
interface to push the changes to the SD2E tenant.

#### Modify an Agave app

This is an example Agave app `json` file from
[another section](03.create_app_02.md) of this user guide:
```
{
  "name": "username-fastqc",
  "version": "0.11.7",
  "executionType": "HPC",
  "executionSystem": "hpc-tacc-maverick-username",
  "parallelism": "SERIAL",
  "deploymentPath": "username/apps/fastqc-0.11.7",
  "deploymentSystem": "data-sd2e-projects-users",
  "defaultProcessorsPerNode": 1,
  "defaultNodeCount": 1,
  "defaultQueue": "normal",
  "label": "FastQC",
  "modules": [ "load tacc-singularity/2.3.1" ],
  "shortDescription": "A Quality Control application for FastQ files",
  "templatePath": "runner-template.sh",
  "testPath": "tester.sh",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "fastq",
      "value": {
        "default": "agave://data-sd2e-community/sample/sailfish/test/read1.fastq",
        "visible": true,
        "required": true
      },
      "details": {
        "label": "FASTQ sequence file"
      },
      "semantics": {
        "ontology": [ "http://edamontology.org/format_1930" ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "parameters": [],
  "outputs": []
}
```

If a new version of FastQC was released (e.g. 0.11.8), that would be cause to
[create a new app](03.create_app.md), using this current app as a template.
A case where it would be appropriate to modify an existing app is, for example,
to add a default file for the `fastq` input.

If you followed the [Create Custom Applications](03.create_app.md) user guide,
then you may have a sample fastq file located here:

`agave://data-tacc-work-username/sd2e-data/sample/SP1.fq`

Modify the original `app.json` file to include the complete URI to this sample
data as follows (only one line is edited, all other parts untouched):
```
...
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "fastq",
      "value": {
        "default": "agave://data-tacc-work-username/sd2e-data/sample/SP1.fq",
        "visible": true,
        "required": true
      },
...
```

Then, update the app in the SD2E tenant by performing the following:
```
% apps-addupdate -F app.json fastq-username-0.11.7
```

If successful, Agave will automatically append a suffix of `u1`, `u2`, `u3`, etc.,
incrementing each time the app is updated. To confirm that the changes have taken
place, verbosely list the contents of the app:
```
% apps-search name.like='*fastq*'
username-fastqc-0.11.7
username-fastqc-0.11.7u1     # this is the updated app

% apps-list -v username-fastqc-0.11.7u1
```

After carefully testing the updated app, if you are satisfied with its operation,
you may consider disabling the earlier app. The following command toggles the
`available` flag to `false`:
```
% apps-disable username-fastqc-0.11.7
```
