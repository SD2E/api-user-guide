##### *NOTE: The app building guide presented here is a work in progress, and it uses a development branch of the SD2E CLI. Please proceed with caution. If you would instead prefer to follow the old, but safe, app building guide, please go [here](old/03.old_create_app.md)*



<br><br><br>
You can find Agave applications ("apps") in the SD2E catalog by using the `apps-list`
command described [previously](02.find_application.md). What if the app you are
looking for is not available? Using the Agave CLI, you can create your own.

<br>
#### Components of an app

The essential components you need to create your own app are:

1. A Docker image containing the executable and all runtime dependencies
2. A wrapper script (generally written in bash) that runs the executable
3. A test script (also written in bash) for testing the executable outside of the Agave environment

Several example apps exist and all components are visible. For example, visit the
[SD2E Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/sd2e/) to view existing app containers.
And, example app bundles can be viewed on the
[SD2E GitHub page](https://github.com/SD2E/reactors-etl/tree/master/reactors)
or [SD2E GitLab](https://gitlab.sd2e.org/).

#### Create your own by example

The best way to demonstrate the creation of a custom app is by example. The
following sub-pages will go through the process:

1. [Set up your environment](03.create_app_01.md)
2. [Initiate the app directory](03.create_app_02.md)
3. [Containerize the executable](03.create_app_03.md)
4. [Deploy and submit a test job](03.create_app_04.md)
5. [Best practices and next steps](03.create_app_05.md)
