title: Storage and Execution System Basics

An Agave *system* is a server or collection of servers associated with a single
hostname. They may be public or private, and they may either be **storage** systems
(used for storing files) or **execution** systems (used for running jobs).

In SD2E, we provide all users with private storage and execution systems attached to
TACC resources. If you would like to create your own systems attached to different
resources, skip ahead to [Create Private Systems](02.create_systems.md).


<br>
#### Find your systems

Systems where you are able to store and access data (called storage systems) can
be found using the `systems-list` command with a `-S` flag:
```
% systems-list -S
data-sd2e-community
data-tacc-work-username
data-sd2e-projects-users
data-sd2e-projects-etldev
data-sd2e-app-assets
```
Here is a quick summary of the default storage systems and how they relate to
the [SD2E portal](https://sd2e.org/):

* `data-tacc-work-username`: Your personal directory on the TACC `$WORK` filesystem. You have `+rw` and sharing access. This will show up in the portal as **My Data**.

* `data-sd2e-community`: Project-wide shared data. Unless you are specifically authorized, it is read-only. This will show up in the portal as **Community Data**.

* `data-sd2e-projects-*`: These are subproject storage spaces. Your access rights will be variable. These will show up in the portal under **My Projects**.

* `data-sd2e-app-assets`: This system is private to SD2E staff and read-only. It will not show up in the portal.

<br>
Systems where you are able to execute commands and run jobs (called execution systems)
can be found with the following command:
```
% systems-list -E
hpc-tacc-wrangler
hpc-tacc-jetstream
cli-tacc-wrangler
```
Execution systems come in two different flavors: HPC (high performance computing)
and CLI (command line interface). HPC-type execution systems are used for submitting
a job to a queueing system on a cluster. CLI-type executiong systems are used for
running jobs on the command line or on a dedicated, on-demand resource (e.g. AWS
or [Jetstream](https://jetstream-cloud.org)).

Here is a quick summary of the default execution systems:

* `hpc-tacc-ls5-username`: Your personal execution system for the TACC [Lonestar5](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/lonestar5) supercomputer. Jobs run against this execution system will be submitted to the Lonestar5 job queue on your behalf.

* `hpc-tacc-wrangler-username`: Your personal execution system for the TACC [Wrangler](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/wrangler) supercomputer. Jobs run against this execution system will be submitted to the Wrangler job queue on your behalf.

* `*-tacc-wrangler`: Public HPC and CLI execution system for the TACC [Wrangler](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/wrangler) supercomputer. Most SD2E community members have `USER` access and will be able to run public applications set up to run on these systems.

* `hpc-tacc-jetstream`: Public CLI execution system for the TACC [Jetstream](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/jetstream) cloud resource. Most SD2E community members have `USER` access and will be able to run public applications set up to run on these systems.

*Tip: use '`systems-list -h`' to see more usage options*

#### Verbose system information

To see additional system information, including hostname, root folder locations,
and availability, use the verbose flag with a system ID. For example, find out more
information about your personal storage system as follows:
```
% systems-list -v data-tacc-work-username
{
  "owner": "sd2eadm",
  "_links": {
    "owner": {
      "href": "https://api.sd2e.org/profiles/v2/sd2eadm"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "href": "https://api.sd2e.org/meta/v2/data/?q=%7B%22associationIds%22%3A%223474211147285074407-242ac11a-0001-006%22%7D"
    },

    },
    "roles": {
      "href": "https://api.sd2e.org/systems/v2/data-tacc-work-username/roles"
    },
    "self": {

    },
    "publicAppsDir": null,
    "host": "data.tacc.utexas.edu",

}
```

As described above, this storage system is a gateway to your private storage
space on the TACC `$WORK` filesystem. The `rootDir` is the virtual root path
for operations performed on this system.

Similar information can be seen when querying execution systems:
```

```

In addition to standard host and path information, execution systems also contain
information about queue types and availability.

#### Set a default system

You may find that most of the [file operations](02.data_management.md) you
perform are against your private TACC storage system - `data-tacc-work-username`.
To avoid typing the full name of the system with every file command, you may set
it as the default system with:
```
% systems-setdefault data-tacc-work-username
Successfully set data-tacc-work-username as the default storage system for username
```
