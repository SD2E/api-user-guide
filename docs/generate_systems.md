title: Generate HPC and STORAGE Systems
tagline:

An Agave *system* is a server or collection of servers associated with a single
hostname. They may be public or private, and they may either be STORAGE systems
(used for storing files) or HPC systems (used for running jobs).

For SD2E, we provide all users with private HPC and STORAGE systems attached to
TACC resources. If you would like to create your own systems attached to different
resources, follow the instructions below.


We provide a script for you to generate private HPC and STORAGE systems. You need:

* ssh tokens
* hostname
* paths
